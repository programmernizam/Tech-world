It works very well, I currently play Skyrim with about 79 mods and I have a stray 55 FPS at ultra settings.  Battery while playing games is abysmal (only 1 1/2 hrs) but when I’m just browsing and streaming it lasts about 5-7 hours.  I like it as my first gaming laptop.",

I bought it for my 16th birthday predominately for VR usage with my quest 2, and it more than delivers. It runs pretty much any game smoothly with great graphics. I do recommend  getting a cooling pad and keeping it plugged in but those are my only two suggestions",

      "review_text": "Great computer. I got it for 800 on a weekend deal. At that price point it far outpaces anything else that I could find.  Battery life is about 2 hours though so that is the big downside. The smaller ram stick is also not ideal, but I haven't actually noticed any lag in performance because of it",
